This project aims to develop a comprehensive workout-tracking application that provides fitness enthusiasts with a variety of features. The application will include all kind of features, such as tracking
workouts, adding new exercises, and creating new workout routines as well as following preexisting powerlifting or bodybuilding workouts and plans. In spite of this, the application will be focused
primarily on social aspects. Users will be able to interact with friends and join groups where they compete and compare their sports activities and achievements. There will be a wide variety of possible
organizations and groups, including small friend groups, small communities, schools, universities, large corporations, and many others. 

Users will be able to see their rankings in each group that they are part of, as well as the rankings of other users. These rankings can be based on overall sports performance metrics, strictly strength-
based, or a mixture of both, depending on the group settings. A worldwide ranking system will enable each group of users to compare themselves with other groups - this feature will add competition
between groups and organizations. 

The social aspect is the key focus of the application, it will connect users from different organizations and groups, including small friend groups, small communities, schools, universities, big companies, and
more. Providing a competitive and social environment will motivate users to stay on track with their fitness goals and improve their physical and mental health. The platform will connect users with
like-minded individuals and will encourage them to share their fitness progress. The project is initiated by a group of students with a passion for sports. Our team members
are mostly focused in Computer Science and are experienced in Software development as well as entrepreneurship. 

We’ve been using workout tracking apps for years and are yet to see a product which fulfills our requirements and provides a seamless experience on top of it. Furthermore we believe that current market options don’t put enough emphasis on the social side. 
Companies like Strava have shown that users are interested in social media-like workout app, but it is limited by its focus on running and other long distance activities. In the the following sections of this document we will outline
the project’s goals, objectives, requirements, and deliverables, as well as a timeline for development and potential risks and challenges. 

The goal of this project is to build a mobile application that takes inspiration from available workout-tracking applications and expands the social aspect to engage users with their friends and 
groups they are associated with, similar to social media applications. We gamify working out and help people reach their fitness goals.
