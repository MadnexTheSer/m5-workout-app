After researching the technologies we are going to use, I have encountered some difficulties and formulated important questions.
-> How to create demo data to be visualised during the development process?
-> How are the workout excercise/sets/weight/reps/volume structered and saved?
-> How to create user account and save the data? Where is it stored?
-> How to structure the software files and the code? / Divided by user steps - login,  
-> In order to achieve the first deliverable (offline application that stores data locally, type "Strong") the data needs to be stored and accessed on the device, how?
-> In order to achieve the second deliverable (backup of the data is created and stored, all functionality of "Strong" is achieved) the data needs to be uploaded to the server, how?
